**ye-shirts** is a React-based storefront of infinite Kanye West quote t-shirts, quotes provided by https://api.kanye.rest/.

The storefront is styled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

Once the project is fully functional, I'll be using HTML Canvas and [Fabric.JS](http://fabricjs.com/) to generate images with the quotes actually appearing on the shirts.
